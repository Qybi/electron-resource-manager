# Electron - Resource manager

A small app to learn how Electron functions
Basic resource manager developed using Electron - React - Typescript
Project has been initialized using _electron-vite_ bundler and the base template has been boostrapped using `yarn @quickstart/electron`.
To the base template I only added the `--watch` flag to the `dev` script to be able to hot reload the project while in development

The project uses Antd 5 as its frontend component library
